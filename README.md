## Introduction
AutoSplit64++ is a fork of [AutoSplit64+](https://github.com/DaviBe92/AutoSplit64plus) that adds macOS (Apple Silicon) support, direct window capture on macOS, LiveSplit One support and a resizable window. The rest of this README is based on AutoSplit64+'s.

AutoSplit64+ is an enhanced fork of [AutoSplit64](https://github.com/Kainev/AutoSplit64), providing automated splitting for Super Mario 64 speedruns on console. 
It analyzes captured gameplay to control LiveSplit timer events automatically. 

The project's main objectives are to simplify setup and enhance reliability.

- Capture device/card

## Quick Setup

1. Download the latest [Release](https://github.com/DaviBe92/AutoSplit64/releases).
2. Extract contents and run `AutoSplit64plus.exe`.
3. Set LiveSplit to start at 1.36 seconds.
4. Set Game Capture method and region.
5. Generate Reset Templates.
6. Press Start.

### Interface

All windows and options are accessed via the right-click menu, which the menu button (☰) in the bottom right corner also opens. On macOS, the same menu is also available as `Options` in the menu bar:

## Usage Guide

### LiveSplit

AutoSplit64++ directly communicates with LiveSplit using a Named Pipe. There is no need to manually start the LiveSplit Server.

Since AS64+ recognizes the reset only when the Super Mario 64 logo appears, we need to set the Timer to Start at 1.36 seconds.

In LiveSplit `Right-Click -> Edit Splits...` &rarr; Set `Start Timer at:` to **1.36**

#### LiveSplit One

AutoSplit64++ can also control [LiveSplit One](https://one.livesplit.org) (the web timer):

1. In AutoSplit64++, `Settings -> Connection` &rarr; set `Connection Mode` to **LiveSplit One**. It listens on port `16835` by default. The dot in the top right corner shows the server state (green: connected, amber: waiting for LiveSplit One, red: could not start). Hover it for the URL and click it to copy the URL.
2. In LiveSplit One, `Settings -> Server Connection -> Connect` &rarr; enter `ws://localhost:16835`.
3. Click `OK` to leave LiveSplit One's settings. LiveSplit One ignores timer commands while its settings are open.

In LiveSplit One, `Splits -> Edit` &rarr; Set `Start Timer at` to **1.36**.

### Game Capture

There are 2 options to capture the game:
- **OBS Plugin** (*preffered*)
- **Window Capture** 

#### OBS Plugin

The AutoSplit64+ Grabber OBS plugin sends the gameplay directly to AutoSplit64+ before any modifications are done to it. Changing size, adding effects, overlays, etc. are not captured do not influence the result. 

##### Install Plugin:
- Close OBS
- Copy the plugin file `autosplit64plus-framegrabber.dll` located in `AutpSplit64plus/OBS-Plugin` to your OBS plugin folder
- Usually located in `C:\Program Files\obs-studio\obs-plugins\64bit`
- Open OBS
- Open the Filters Menu of your capture card source (`Right-Click -> Filters`)
- Add (+) Effects Filter and choose `AS64+ Frame Grabber`
![OBS Filter Menu](repo/obs_filters_screen.png)
![OBS Plugin](repo/obs_plugin_screen.png)

- If you have any other Filters applied, make sure `AS64+ Frame Grabber` is at the very top
- Close Filters Menu
##### Setup AutoSplit64++:
- Open the Capture Editor in AutoSplit64++ (`Right-Click -> Edit Coordinates`):

![OBS Plugin Capture](repo/capture_screen_obs.png)

- Check `Use OBS Plugin`
- Pressing `Capture Screen` will update the shown frame.
- Make sure a frame in a bright environment is shown, like the one above.
- Pressing `Auto Detect Region` should correctly position the `Game Region selector` as shown. 

If the region was not detected poperly, adjust the region manually and ensure it is as accurate as possible for best results. When in doubt, its better to select 1-2 pixels into the game as shown above. Selecting even 1 pixel outside of the game area will cause issues!

- Press `Apply` to save changes.

#### Window Capture
Window Capture will take a screenshot of the selected programm 30 times/second.

- Make sure you have your capture software open (i.e.AmaRecTV)
- Open the Capture Editor in AutoSplit64++ (`Right-Click -> Edit Coordinates`):
 
![Window Capture](repo/capture_screen_window.png)

- Uncheck `Use OBS Plugin`
- Select the desired process from the `Process` drop-down.
- Pressing `Capture Screen` will update the shown frame.
- Make sure a frame in a bright environment is shown, like the one above.
- When using AmaRecTV, pressing `Auto Detect Region` should correctly position the `Game Region selector` as shown. 

When capturing another progamm or the region was not detected poperly, adjust the region manually and ensure it is as accurate as possible for best results. When in doubt, its better to select 1-2 pixels into the game as shown above. Selecting even 1 pixel outside of the game area will cause issues!

- Press `Apply` to save changes.

**NOTE:**
If you are using a correctly configured version of AmaRecTV as shown (with windows size at 100% `Right-Click AmaRecTV -> 100%`), the default settings should already be set appropriately.

#### Capture on macOS
On macOS, the Capture Editor's `Source` chooses what to capture. Each source needs its own permission, and the editor only asks for the one of the selected source. While it's missing, the editor shows a button that asks macOS for it, and an `Open System Settings` button in case it was denied before. When running from source, the permissions are for your terminal app instead.

**Video Device** captures a capture card, the OBS Virtual Camera or a webcam. Select it in the `Device` drop-down. It needs the Camera permission.

**Window** streams the emulator window directly with ScreenCaptureKit (the same API used by screen sharing apps), so neither OBS nor a virtual camera is needed. It needs the Screen Recording permission; restart AutoSplit64++ after allowing it if the editor doesn't pick it up.
- The window can be behind other windows, but not minimized.
- Select your emulator in the `Process` drop-down. The capture includes the window's title bar, so make sure the `Game Region` only covers the game.
- Don't resize the emulator window after setting the region. If you do, set the region again.

### Routes

We must let AutoSplit 64 know when we want splits to occur. This can be done by using the Route Editor (`Right-Click -> Edit Route`) to generate route files.

A regular split will trigger when the specified number of stars have been collected, and a set amount of fadeouts or fadeins have occurred after the star count was reached, or the last split occurred.

Every time a star is collected, or a split, undo or skip is triggered, the fadeout and fadein count are reset to 0.
The Route Editor has been designed to look and function similar to the split editor found in LiveSplit to make it as familiar as possible.

**The easiest method of creating routes is to import your splits you use for LiveSplit. To do this, in the Route Editor, nagivate to `File -> Convert LSS`. Open the `.lss` file you use with LiveSplit. AutoSplit 64 will attempt to fill in as many details as possible to simplify the route creation process, however it is important you check each split to make sure it is correct.**

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, please run through all steps below.

- Check capture coordinates are correct (`Right Click -> Edit Coordinates`)
- When using TCP connection, ensure LiveSplit server is running (`Right Click LiveSplit -> Control -> Start Server')
- Check the correct route is loaded, and that the route file is accurate (i.e. correct star counts, fadeout/fadein counts)
- Make sure SRL Mode (Right Click -> SRL Mode) is disabled if you want AutoSplit64 to detect console resets
- Generate reset templates (`Right Click -> Generate Reset Templates`)
- Enlarge your game capture window if it is very small
- Make sure the captures colour settings (i.e. saturation) are default or close to default
- If using an unpowered splitter, compare the whiteness of your star select screens to other players. If it is extremely dull you may need to increase your capture brightness
- Ensure your capture is set to a 4:3 aspect ratio (or close to)

## Development
AutoSplit64++ uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage Python and its dependencies. [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), then run these from the repository. uv sets up Python 3.12 and the dependencies from `uv.lock` the first time.

- Start AutoSplit64++: `uv run AutoSplit64.py`
- Run the tests: `uv run python -m unittest`
- Add or update a dependency: `uv add <package>`, which updates `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`

### Building
Run `uv run build.py` on the platform you're building for:
- Windows: creates `dist/AutoSplit64++/` with `AutoSplit64++.exe`. Keep the exe together with the other files in that folder.
- macOS: creates `dist/AutoSplit64++.app`. Move it to `Applications` (or anywhere else) to install it.

### macOS (Apple Silicon)
On macOS, the Named Pipe connection and the OBS Plugin are not available. Use the LiveSplit One (or TCP) connection mode.

The app stores its settings, log, routes and reset templates in `~/Library/Application Support/AutoSplit64++/`. Installing a new build keeps them.
